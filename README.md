# Cuando

This would be a system to properly find a time when to schedule online meetings.
The planned features are:
- First class supports for time zones
- ability to quickly create/select multiple time slots
- nice UI

This is an hobby project (so progress is slow) born out of the frustration of not finding a online tool that does its job. Due to the relative simplicity of this kind of website I decided to develop my own one.

[Doodle](https://doodle.com) is overall the best one but selecting multiple dates is a pain, [zvite](https://zvite.co) solve that problem but lack everything else.
Then websites like [when2meet.com](https://www.when2meet.com/) almost do their job but the UI is too bad.

The temporary name cuando, in spanish means when.
